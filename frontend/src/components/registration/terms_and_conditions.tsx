Last Updated: August 30, 2025
Welcome to flywithsigma.com (the "Platform"), operated by Fly with Sigma ("we," "us," "our"). These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our Platform and its services for searching, booking, and managing flight reservations.
By accessing or using our Platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use our Platform.
1. Scope of Our Services
Fly with Sigma acts as an intermediary or agent. We provide a platform through which you can enter into a contract with a third-party airline ("Airline"). We do not operate any flights ourselves.
When you book a flight through our Platform, you are purchasing a ticket directly from the Airline, and you are subject to the Airline's terms and conditions of carriage, fare rules, and policies. Your contract for the flight service is between you and the respective Airline.
We are responsible for the booking process on our Platform, transmitting your payment, and providing you with a booking confirmation and e-ticket. We are not responsible for the flight service itself, including but not limited to delays, cancellations, lost baggage, or denied boarding.
2. User Responsibilities and Account
Eligibility: You must be at least 18 years of age and have the legal capacity to enter into binding contracts to use our Platform.
Account Security: If you create an account, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account details. You are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account.
Accurate Information: You are solely responsible for providing accurate and complete information for all travelers, including names, dates of birth, contact details, and passport information. Names provided must exactly match the government-issued photo ID or passport to be used for travel. We are not liable for any issues arising from incorrect information you provide. Any costs associated with correcting such errors will be your responsibility.
3. Booking and Confirmation Process
Search and Selection: The flight options presented on our Platform are based on information provided by airlines and global distribution systems. We do not guarantee the availability of any specific fare until the booking is complete.
Booking Request: Submitting a booking request does not constitute a confirmed reservation.
Confirmation: Your booking is confirmed only when we have processed your payment successfully and have issued a valid e-ticket number. You will receive a booking confirmation email with your e-ticket details. If you do not receive this within 24 hours of booking, please contact our customer service.
Pricing: Prices displayed are dynamic and not guaranteed until ticketing is complete. The final price, including all taxes and fees, will be displayed before you confirm your payment. In the rare event of a pricing error, we reserve the right to cancel the booking and offer you a full refund or the option to pay the correct price.
4. Payments and Fees
Payment: We accept payments via the methods displayed on the payment page (e.g., credit card, debit card, online banking). By providing payment information, you authorize us to process the transaction for the total booking amount.
Service Fees: We may charge a non-refundable service fee for processing your booking. This fee, if applicable, will be clearly displayed as part of the total cost before you complete your payment.
Currency: All transactions are processed in Thai Baht (THB). If you are paying with a card issued in a different currency, your bank may charge a conversion fee.
5. Changes, Cancellations, and Refunds
All requests for changes and cancellations are subject to the specific fare rules of your ticket, which are determined by the Airline. Many fares are restrictive, non-changeable, and non-refundable.
Governing Rules: The Airline's fare rules, penalties, and policies will govern all changes, cancellations, and refunds.
Our Fees: In addition to any fees charged by the Airline, Fly with Sigma may charge a non-refundable administrative fee for processing any voluntary change or cancellation request.
How to Request: All change or cancellation requests must be made through our Platform or by contacting our customer service during business hours.
Refunds: If your ticket is eligible for a refund, we will process your request with the Airline. Refunds will only be credited back to you after we have received the funds from the Airline. The processing time can vary significantly. No-shows are typically non-refundable.
6. Baggage, Seats, and Other Ancillary Services
Baggage Allowance: Baggage policies and fees are set by the Airline. The allowance can vary based on the airline, fare class, and route. We will display the available baggage information during the booking process, but you are responsible for verifying the most current baggage policy directly with the Airline.
Seat Selection: Paid or free seat selection is subject to the Airline's policy and availability. The Airline reserves the right to change seat assignments for operational, safety, or security reasons.
7. Travel Documents and Requirements
Responsibility: It is your sole responsibility to ensure that you and all travelers in your booking have all necessary travel documents.
Passport & Visas: You must have a valid passport for all international travel. Many countries require passports to be valid for at least six months beyond your planned return date. You are responsible for obtaining all required visas, transit visas, and entry permits.
Health: You are responsible for checking and fulfilling all health and vaccination requirements for your destination(s) and transit point(s).
Liability: We are not liable if you are denied entry to a country or denied boarding on a flight due to your failure to carry the correct and adequate passport, visa, or other required travel documents.
8. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, Fly with Sigma shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages resulting from:
The acts, errors, omissions, warranties, or negligence of any Airline or other third-party supplier.
Personal injury, death, property damage, or other damages arising from the flight service itself.
Flight cancellations, delays, strikes, force majeure events (including but not limited to pandemics, natural disasters, and acts of war), or other causes beyond our direct control.
Our liability, if any, for any claim arising from our services is limited to the amount of the service fee you paid to us in connection with the transaction.

All content on this Platform, including text, graphics, logos, and software, is the property of Fly with Sigma or its licensors and is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You may not use, reproduce, or distribute any content from this Platform without our prior written permission.

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Thailand, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Nonthaburi, Thailand.
11. Amendments to These Terms
We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will post the revised terms on the Platform and update the "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the Platform after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.`;
